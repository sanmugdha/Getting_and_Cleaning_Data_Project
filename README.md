# Getting and Cleaning Data Project
This repository holds the R script for the final project for the Getting and Cleaning Data course offered by Coursera. The script run_analysis.R does the following

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

* Note that this script assumes the data for the assignment has been downloaded is in your current working direcory, and names of files have not been altered.

* dplyr package must be installed

This repo also contains Codebook.md which describes the variables and the data.

The output of the R script is a text file avg_data.txt and is also contained in this repo.
